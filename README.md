# ImageProcessing
Both assignments for Image Processing (CSCE 5683 with Dr. Khoa Luu). I wrote almost all of the submitted code for both of these projects (Minus the Otsu's implmementation, and the ChanVese LevelSets).

1. Assignment1: Histogram Calculation/Equalization, Image Quantization and Smoothing.
2. Assignment2: Invariant Feature Detection (SIFT and SURF), Binary Segmentation (Otsu's), and Multiple Region Segmentation (ChanVese Level-Sets)
