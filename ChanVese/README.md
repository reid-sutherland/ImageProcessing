ChanVese
========

Code implementing the Chan-Vese segmentation algorithm in C++, and a simplified version in Matlab.  The PDF contains my report on this project.  

NOTE: looks like the .pgm test file is garbage.  Will fix this...

I wrote this code and the report for the graduate course ECE 532, Image Analysis, at the University of Arizona in 2009 under professor Jeff Rodriguez.
