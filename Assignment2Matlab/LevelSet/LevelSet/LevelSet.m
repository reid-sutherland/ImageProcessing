% 
% This Matlab/C code performs level set image segmentation using 
% 
%  (1) Several multiphase (or multiregion) methods, including a fast scheme which results
%      in a significant reduction in the computational load (the complexity grows linearly
%      as a function of the number of regions).
% 
%  (2) Several region-based image descriptions more complex than the standard piecewise 
%      constant Chan-Vese model, including
% 
%      - A Gamma description that is applicable to image data corrupted with a multiplicative
%        noise, e.g., data of the type SAR (synthetic aperture radar) in remote sensing, and of
%        the type ultrasound, in medical imaging.
%  
%      - A kernel-mapping description that is flexible enough to be applicable to a variety of 
%        real images and noise types, including medical, satellite and natural images.
%

% 
% These functions were tested on the following versions of MATLAB and C
%    MATLAB version: 7.7.0.471 (R2008b)

addpath '/home/reid/ImageProcessing/Assignment2Matlab/LevelSet/LevelSet/Assig2_Supp'
input_image='Assig2_Supp/Q3-Images/cyclist.jpg';
output_image='Assig2_Supp/Q3-Results/cyclist10.jpg';

nb_iterations='50';
curvature='20';
time_step='0.001';
display_frequency='5';

% Description of the inputs

% a) input_image: the image to be segmented

% b) output_image: the segmentation result

% c) output_image: the segmentation result

% d) nb_regions: the number of segmentation regions

% e) nb_iterations: the number of iterations

% f) curvature: the weight of the curvature velocity (or  smoothness term).
%    The higher the weight, the smoother the segmentation boundaries. Noisy images (e.g., SAR data) 
%    often require a high smoothness weight, e.g., curvature='2000'.

% g) time_step: the gradient-descent time step of curve evolution. a large step yields faster 
%    evolution but lesser stability. Typical values of this parameter are in between 0.0001 and
%    0.001. 
%   
% h) display_frequency:  the frequency of display of the active curve during the evolution. 
%    For instance, when display_frequency='20', the active curve is superimposed on the image each
%    20 iterations.

% i) initialization: this option defines the initial curves which can be either circles centered
%    about the middle of the image (initialization='1') or small circles all over the input 
%    image (initialization='1'). 

% j) segmentation_method: this variable defines the image model and/or the multiphase method. 
%     The following lists and explains the possible options for this variable:
      
%      - segmentation method =  'gamma'
      
%      This function implements level set image segmentation by minimizing a data term which measures
%      the conformity of image data within each region to the Gamma model. It is usefull for image 
%      data corrupted with a multiplicative noise such as in radar and ultrasound data. Please cite 
%      the following paper in any resulting publication:

%          aperture radar images,� IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 
%          vol. 27, no. 5, pp. 793�800, 2005.
  
%       Note that this gamma segmentation function requires a small time step, e.g., time_step='0.0001'.

%      - segmentation method =  'ker'

%      This  method implements a kernel function which maps implicitly the original image data into data
%      of a higher dimension so that the piecewise constant model becomes applicable to images corrupted 
%      with various noise models. This leads to a flexible alternative to complex modeling of the image 
%      data. The function is applicable to a variety of real images such as medical, satellite and natural 
%      images. Please cite the following paper in any resulting publication:

%          Induced MData Term, IEEE Transactions on Image processing, vol. 19, no 1, pp. 220-232, 2010. 

%       Note that this kernel segmentation function requires a small time step, e.g., time_step='0.0001'.
  
%       - Segmentation method =  'mean'

%       This function implements level set image segmentation by minimizing the classical Chan-Vese data 
%       term which measures the conformity of image data within each region to the piecewise constant model. 

%       - Segmentation method =  'Gaussian'
%         This function implements a Gaussian generalization of the classical  piecewise constant model.
    
%     Note that the case of a number of regions more than 2 (the multiphase case) uses several curves which 
%   can intersect. Therefore, a two-region formulation cannot be generalized directly by assigning a region
%   to the interior of each curve because region membership becomes ambiguous when the curves intersect.  
%   The following lists the possible options to evolve multiple curves so that, at convergence, the curves
%   define a partition of the image domain:

%       - Segmentation method = 'clust'

%         This method embeds directly a simple partition constraint in the curve evolution equations. 
%         Starting from an arbitrary initial  partition, the constraints implements the rule that if 
%         a point leaves a region, it is claimed by a single other region. The scheme is fast, and 
%         results in a significant reduction in the computational load (the complexity grows linearly
%         as a function of the number of regions). Please cite the following papers in any resulting

%        - Segmentation method = 'part'

%         This method implements a systematic general mapping between the segmentation regions and the 
%         regions defined by the curves and their intersections. The mapping guarantees, by definition,
%         a partition at all times during curve evolution. Please cite the following paper in any resulting

%             101, no. 3, pp. 137�150, 2006.

%        - Segmentation method = 'ker_part'

%          This option implements the kernel method in [2] with the multiphase method in [6]. Please cite these
%          two papers in any resulting publication. 


%     Note that when Segmentation method = 'gamma',  'ker', 'mean' or 'gaussian' and when the number of regions is 
%  more than 2 (nb_regions> 2), the default multiphase method is the one described in the following papers:

%             global curve evolution method,� IEEE ICIP 2004, pp. 3467-3470.

%      This multiphase method views image segmentation as spatially regularized image data clustering, leading to the 
%      simultaneous minimization of N ?1 functionals to segment an image into N regions, each minimization involving 
%      a single region and its complement. Please cite [7] in any resulting publication.
